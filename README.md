toortools
=========

Collection of small tools and classes I regularly use in my projects. I also created wrappers for lots and lots of small snippets of code that I find my self googling all the time.

It is created based on my needs and my programming style. I have tried to create it as parameterizable and static as possible.

If you have any suggestions please let me know.

Some things included:

    - Quickly download a URL with Cookie,
